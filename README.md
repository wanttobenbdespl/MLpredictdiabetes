The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning based diabetes prediction model using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset available on the Kaggle platform. The dataset contains several health indicators from Pima Indian women, including but not limited to body mass index (BMI), blood glucose levels, blood pressure, etc., and these characteristics are significantly correlated with the occurrence of diabetes. Through in-depth analysis and modelling of these data, we hope to accurately predict the probability of an individual developing diabetes.
In addition, to improve the ease of use of the model, we constructed a user-friendly front-end interface. The interface is designed to simplify the user input process so that anyone can easily enter their personal health data and instantly obtain diabetes risk assessment results. In this way, we hope to increase public awareness of early diabetes screening and provide strong support for related health management.
